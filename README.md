# Excel_Projects
In this Excel project, the primary objective is to clean the data and create an informative dashboard for better understanding. For every procedure, a different worksheet is made in order to guarantee that the raw data is preserved. To guarantee data accuracy, the initial stage involves cleansing the data by eliminating any duplicate entries. The Find and Replace function is used to replace any short forms in the dataset with their full forms in order to improve understanding. For simplicity and uniformity, decimal points are also eliminated from the income statistics.

In order to organize the age data into categories for simpler analysis, a new age bracket column is generated. A nested IF() function is used to accomplish this, classifying each age into one of three groups: "Adolescent," "Middle Age," or "Old." This classification makes age-related computations and insights easier to understand.

The next step of the project is to create and illustrate three primary pivot tables. The first pivot table, broken out by gender, determines the average income of people who purchased or did not purchase a bike. The association between client travel distances and the quantity of bikes purchased is examined in the second pivot table. The age groups that have bought bikes are examined in the third pivot table.
All of the pivot table charts are displayed in a comprehensive dashboard that offers an understandable and dynamic visual representation of the data. Slicers, which enable users to filter the data based on gender, education level, and region, are introduced to the dashboard to improve user involvement. This interactive feature enables more in-depth comprehension of the dataset and permits personalized views according to particular standards.

The project successfully purges, organizes, and visualizes the data to improve its accessibility and comprehensibility. Better insights and decision-making are made possible by the project's transformation of unstructured data into an eye-catching dashboard. A comprehensive approach to data management and visualization in Excel is demonstrated via the combination of data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and interactive dashboard building.
